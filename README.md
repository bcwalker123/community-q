# Community-Q — Community Intelligence, Simplified

**One-liner**  
Ask your community questions and get fast, evidence-backed answers — plus actions — from Discord, Slack, forums, YouTube, Twitch, support tickets, etc.

## What is Community-Q?

Community-Q is an early-stage community intelligence web app that helps product, support, and community teams transform scattered discussion into prioritized, actionable insights.

Instead of manually reading through dozens or hundreds of threads and tickets, you ask plain-language questions (e.g. “What are the top feature requests this month?”) and Community-Q responds with a concise answer, a confidence score, and direct evidence (post excerpts with source and timestamp). From there you can convert insights into actions (tickets, messages, polls).

This repo contains a simple single-folder demo scaffold:

- Frontend: React + TypeScript (Vite)
- Backend: Node.js + Express (server-side demo endpoints)

> The `/api/qna` endpoint in `server.js` currently returns a canned response for demo purposes. In production you’ll replace that with a retrieval + LLM synthesis pipeline (RAG).

## Problems Community-Q solves

- **Scattered feedback:** conversations live in Discord, Slack, forums, support tools and socials — no single source of truth.
- **Slow manual analysis:** reading messages manually is time-consuming and error-prone.
- **Signal vs noise:** a few loud voices may not represent the whole community.
- **Action gaps:** insights rarely become tracked tasks or outreach without manual effort.
- **Late detection:** teams miss early warning signs of bugs, outages, or churn risk.

---

## What data is shown

Community-Q’s core UI and systems are designed to surface:

- **Top topics** and mention counts (e.g., “multi-account switching — 42 mentions”)
- **Evidence snippets** (short excerpts with source and timestamp)
- **Sentiment trends** over time for topics or the overall community
- **Top contributors** and at-risk members (basic influence metrics)
- **Alerts** for keyword spikes or abnormal behavior
- **Action history** (tickets, polls, outreach created from insights)

---

## Key features

**AI Q&A (RAG-ready)**  
Ask natural-language questions. The app retrieves supporting evidence, synthesizes an answer, and returns a confidence metric and snippets. (Demo endpoint returns canned results.)

**Multi-source ingestion (backend work)**  
Connectors for Discord, Slack, Discourse/forums, and CSV imports for support exports. (Connector plumbing is out of scope for the demo; backend placeholders show where to integrate.)

**Evidence-first answers**  
Every AI-generated answer lists the specific posts that support it — no hallucinations without trace.

**Action cards**  
Convert insights into tickets (Jira/GitHub/Asana), post polls, or message advocates — directly from the insight view. (UI level in the product roadmap.)

**Privacy & governance**  
Configurable retention windows, PII redaction, member opt-outs, and audit logs.

## User flows & examples

**Example queries**

- “Top 5 feature requests in the last 90 days.”
- “Which members are at risk of churning?”
- “Has sentiment about the mobile app dropped in the last 2 weeks?”

**Example outcome**

- Community-Q returns: top items + evidence snippets + confidence.
- Team converts the highest-priority insight into a ticket and assigns an owner.
- Later: measure time-to-resolution and sentiment change.

## Technical architecture & stack

**Frontend**

- React + TypeScript (Vite)
- Single-page UI with a landing / Q&A demo

**Backend**

- Node.js + Express
- Demo `/api/qna` endpoint (canned). Replace with a RAG pipeline that:
  - stores / indexes evidence (vector DB)
  - retrieves top-k evidence
  - synthesizes answer with LLM (server-side)

**Data & infra (production suggestions)**

- Relational DB (Postgres) for metadata (communities, members, posts)
- Vector DB (Pinecone / Weaviate / Milvus) for embeddings / retrieval
- LLM provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, or self-hosted) for synthesis
- Object storage (S3 / compatible) for attachments
- Auth: OAuth / SSO (SSO via SAML/OIDC for enterprises)
- Deployment: Vercel / Netlify for frontend, Render / Heroku / AWS ECS for backend (or single container that serves both)
